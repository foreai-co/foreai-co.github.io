# Completeness
### (Coming soon)
The metric answers the question: **Are all aspects of the question answered?**

Depends on:
- LLM's generated response;
- User query/question.

Example:
- **Q**: *At which temperature does oxygen boil and freeze?*
- **A1**: *Oxygen boils at -183 °C.* `[completeness score = 0.5]`
- **A2**: *Oxygen boils at -183 °C and freezes at -219 °C.* `[completeness score = 1.0]
