[fore ai's](https://foreai.co) vision centered around "Reliable Artificial Intelligence" is not just a strategic choice; it's a commitment to ensuring the responsible development and deployment of cutting-edge technology. In a landscape where AI applications are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, a commitment to "Reliable Artificial Intelligence" ensures that innovation is coupled with a steadfast dedication to ethical and dependable practices.

We are a team of ex-Google engineers who have worked on quality for apps ranging from Search, Maps, Ads and Shopping, to most recently, Lens: the worldâ€™s most used visual AI application. We want to bring the set of tools and practices that we had taken for granted
at Google for use in the wider AI community.
